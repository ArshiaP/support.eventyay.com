Here, you can either add a URL of your ticket which might be available on a different website, or you may choose to create your tickets by enabling `Use Ticketing System` that is offered by EventYay.
Once you click on it, this is what pops up:

You have to mention the name of the ticket and the number of free tickets you would like to generate. Clicking on the `Settings` icon opens up numerous editting options where you can make the required changes.

2. Clicking on Paid ticket - The next option is selecting ` Paid Tickets`. It is possible for you to add both paid and free tickets for the same event. Selecting `Paid Ticket` shows more options:

You get an additional option of mentioning the cost of the ticket. Furthermore, EventYay allows you to change the currency, choose your payment method, add disocunt codes, etc. when you choose this option.

Clicking on the `Settings` icon provides you with the same options as of that when you click settings under the `Free Ticket` option.
